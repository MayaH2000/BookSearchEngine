# Book Search Engine
This repository contains code for a book search engine.

# URL of Deployed Application
- https://booksearchengine-s7hz.onrender.com/

# Overview
In this project, I refactored a fully functioning book search engine that uses the Google Books API. The existing codebase uses a RESTful API and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Your task is to refactor the application to use GraphQL queries and mutations with Apollo Server.

# Usage
- Search for books using the Google Books API.
- User authentication: login and signup functionality.
- Ability to save and remove books from user's account.
- View saved books.
- Logout functionality.

# User Story 
As an avid reader, I want to search for new books to read so that I can keep a list of books to purchase.

- ```Upon loading the search engine, users are presented with options to search for books and to login/signup.```
- ```Users can search for books using an input field and a submit button.```
- ```When not logged in, searching for books displays search results with titles, authors, descriptions, images, and links to Google Books.```
- ```Clicking on the login/signup option presents a modal with options to log in or sign up.```
- ```Signing up requires entering a username, email address, and password.```
- ```Logging in requires entering an email address and password.```
- ```Upon successful signup, users are logged in and their account is created.```
- ```Upon successful login, the modal closes and users are logged in.```
- ```When logged in, menu options change to include saved books and logout.```
-``` Searching for books when logged in displays search results with options to save books.```
- ```Saved books can be viewed with titles, authors, descriptions, images, links, and options to remove them.```
-``` Clicking the logout button logs the user out and presents the original menu options.```

# Source
This project is based on starter code provided by KU Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. Leveraging both front-end and back-end expertise, I extended and modified the initial codebase to meet the project requirements.
